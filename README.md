**Propositional Logic**

- Propositional logic is the simplest form of logic.
- In it, facts of the real world are represented by sentences without arguments.


- A proposition will never be both true and false at the same time.
- Principles that must always be obeyed:
  - Principle of identity: A true proposition is true; a false proposition is false.
  - Principle of non-contradiction: No proposition can be both true and false at the same time.
  - Principle of the excluded middle: Every proposition is either true or false, with no other logical state for it.

The logical value of a proposition is:
- Truth if the proposition is true.
- Falsehood if the proposition is false.


- V(p) = Logical value of P = V (True)
- V(q) = Logical value of Q = F (False)


**Which of the sentences below are propositions:**

1. The moon is the only satellite of planet Earth. V(l) = F
2. Stop!
3. Would you like a cup of coffee?
4. The city of Salvador is the capital of the state of Amazonas. V(s) = F
5. The number 712 is odd. V(n) = F
6. I'm not quite sure if I like this color.
7. Fifteen is less than seven. V(q) = F
8. How are you?
9. There is life on other planets in the universe. V(u) = V
10. He is very talented. V(e) = V

# Simple Propositions

**Simple Propositions:** A simple proposition or atomic proposition is one that does not contain any other proposition as an integral part of itself.
- **Notation:** They are generally designated by lowercase letters such as p, q, r, s,..., to represent propositions.
  - Example: p: John is intelligent.

# Compound Propositions

**Compound Propositions:** A compound proposition or molecular proposition is one formed by the combination of two or more propositions.
- **Notation:** They are represented by uppercase letters P, Q, R, S,...

  - **P(p, q):** Felines are furry and birds have feathers.
  - **R(r, s):** I will buy a car or a bicycle.

# Simple Exercise

**Compound Propositions:** If we combine, for example, the following statements: "Elephants are large" and "Basketballs are round", using the "and" connective, we get the proposition: "Elephants are large and basketballs are round".

**What is the formal notation, and the logical value, of the simple propositions and the compound proposition?**

We have "Elephants are large" as formal E = V and "Basketballs are round" as formal B = V. So we have E and B = V. The formal notation for the compound proposition is: E and B.
